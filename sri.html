        <h1 style="font-family:'Caesar Dressing', cursive;font-size: 50px;">Astrobiology</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Astrobiology, formerly known as exobiology, is an interdisciplinary
          scientific field that studies the origins, early evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe.
          Astrobiology considers the question of whether extraterrestrial life exists, and if it does, how humans can
          detect it.<br><br>

          Astrobiology makes use of molecular biology, biophysics, biochemistry, chemistry, astronomy, physical
          cosmology, exoplanetology, geology, paleontology, and ichnology to investigate the possibility of life on
          other worlds and help recognize biospheres that might be different from that on Earth. The origin and early
          evolution of life is an inseparable part of the discipline of astrobiology. Astrobiology concerns itself
          with interpretation of existing scientific data, and although speculation is entertained to give context,
          astrobiology concerns itself primarily with hypotheses that fit firmly into existing scientific
          theories.<br><br>

          This interdisciplinary field encompasses research on the origin of planetary systems, origins of organic
          compounds in space, rock-water-carbon interactions, abiogenesis on Earth, planetary habitability, research on
          biosignatures for life detection, and studies on the potential for life to adapt to challenges on Earth and in
          outer space.<br><br>

          Biochemistry may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when
          the Universe was only 10–17 million years old. According to the panspermia hypothesis, microscopic
          life—distributed by meteoroids, asteroids and other small Solar System bodies—may exist throughout the
          universe. According to research published in August 2015, very large galaxies may be more favorable to
          the creation and development of habitable planets than such smaller galaxies as the Milky Way.
          Nonetheless, Earth is the only place in the universe humans know to harbor life. Estimates of
          habitable zones around other stars, sometimes referred to as "Goldilocks zones", along with
          the discovery of thousands of extrasolar planets and new insights into extreme habitats here on Earth, suggest
          that there may be many more habitable places in the universe than considered possible until very
          recently.<br><br>

          Current studies on the planet Mars by the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers are searching for evidence of
          ancient life as well as plains related to ancient rivers or lakes that may have been
          habitable. The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and
          organic molecules on the planet Mars is now a primary NASA and ESA objective.<br><br>

          Even if extraterrestrial life is never discovered, the interdisciplinary nature of astrobiology, and the
          cosmic and evolutionary perspectives engendered by it, may still result in a range of benefits here on Earth.

        <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Astrobotany is an applied sub-discipline of botany that is the study
          of plants in space environments. It is a branch of astrobiology and botany.<br><br>

          It has been a subject of study that plants may be grown in outer space typically in a weightless but
          pressurized controlled environment in specific space gardens. In the context of human spaceflight, they can
          be consumed as food and/or provide a refreshing atmosphere. Plants can metabolize carbon dioxide in the air
          to produce valuable oxygen, and can help control cabin humidity. Growing plants in space may provide a
          psychological benefit to human spaceflight crews.<br><br>

          The first challenge in growing plants in space is how to get plants to grow without gravity. This runs into
          difficulties regarding the effects of gravity on root development, providing appropriate types of lighting,
          and other challenges. In particular, the nutrient supply to root as well as the nutrient biogeochemical
          cycles, and the microbiological interactions in soil-based substrates are particularly complex, but have been
          shown to make possible space farming in hypo- and micro-gravity.<br><br>

          NASA plans to grow plants in space to help feed astronauts, and to provide psychological benefits for
          long-term space flight.</p><br>

        </h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Astrochemistry is the study of the abundance and reactions of
          molecules in the Universe, and their interaction with radiation. The discipline is an overlap of astronomy
          and chemistry. The word "astrochemistry" may be applied to both the Solar System and the interstellar medium.
          The study of the abundance of elements and isotope ratios in Solar System objects, such as meteorites, is also
          called cosmochemistry, while the study of interstellar atoms and molecules and their interaction with
          radiation is sometimes called molecular astrophysics. The formation, atomic and chemical composition,
          evolution and fate of molecular gas clouds is of special interest, because it is from these clouds that solar
          systems form.</p>

        <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Cosmochemistry (from Greek κόσμος kósmos, "universe" and χημεία
          khemeía) or chemical cosmology is the study of the chemical composition of matter in the universe and the
          processes that led to those compositions. This is done primarily through the study of the chemical
          composition of meteorites and other physical samples. Given that the asteroid parent bodies of meteorites were

        <h1 style="font-family:'Caesar Dressing', cursive;font-size: 50px;">Cosmology</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Cosmology (from Greek κόσμος, kosmos "world" and -λογία, -logia
          "study of") is a branch of astronomy concerned with the study of the chronology of the universe. Physical
          cosmology is the study of the universe's origin, its large-scale structures and dynamics, and the ultimate
          fate of the universe, including the laws of science that govern these areas.<br><br>

          The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up
          in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.<br><br>

          Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric
          literature and traditions of creation myths and eschatology.<br><br>

          Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such
          as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope
          with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions,
          and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be tested. Cosmology differs from astronomy in that the former is
          concerned with the Universe as a whole while the latter deals with individual celestial objects. Modern
          physical cosmology is dominated by the Big Bang theory, which attempts to bring together observational
          astronomy and particle physics; more specifically, a standard parameterization of the Big Bang with dark
          matter and dark energy, known as the Lambda-CDM model.<br><br>

          Theoretical astrophysicist David N. Spergel has described cosmology as a "historical science" because "when we
          look out in space, we look back in time" due to the finite nature of the speed of light.</p>

        <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">The term micro-g environment (also μg, often referred to by the term
          microgravity) is more or less synonymous with the terms weightlessness and zero-g, but with an emphasis on the
          fact that g-forces are never exactly zero—just very small (on the ISS, for example, the small g-forces come
          from tidal effects, gravity from objects other than the Earth, such as astronauts, the spacecraft, and the
          Sun, air resistance, and astronaut movements that impart momentum to the space station). The symbol for
          microgravity, μg, was used on the insignias of Space Shuttle flights STS-87 and STS-107, because these flights
          were devoted to microgravity research in low Earth orbit.<br><br>

          The most commonly known microgravity environment can be found aboard the International Space Station (ISS)
          which is located in low-earth orbit at an altitude of around 400km, orbiting Earth approximately 15 times per
          day in what is considered free fall.<br><br>

          The effects of free fall also enable the creation of short-duration microgravity environments on Earth. This
          is accomplished by using droptube, parabolic flights and Random-positioning machines (RPMs).</p>

          if
          relatively rarely, in forensic science (that is, for solving problems of relevance to the legal system) and

        <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Space medicine is the practice of medicine on astronauts in outer
          space whereas astronautical hygiene is the application of science and technology to the prevention or control
          of exposure to the hazards that may cause astronaut ill health. Both these sciences work together to ensure
          that astronauts work in a safe environment. The main objective is to discover how well and for how long people
          can survive the extreme conditions in space, and how fast they can adapt to the Earth's environment after
          returning from their voyage. Medical consequences such as possible blindness and bone loss have been
          associated with human spaceflight.<br><br>

        <h1 style="font-family:'Caesar Dressing', cursive;font-size: 50px;">Space Architecture
        </h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Space architecture is the theory and practice of designing and
          building inhabited environments in outer space. This mission statement for space architecture was developed
          at the World Space Congress in Houston in 2002 by members of the Technical Aerospace Architecture Subcommittee
          of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). The architectural approach to spacecraft
          design addresses the total built environment. It is mainly based on the field of engineering (especially
          aerospace engineering), but also involves diverse disciplines such as physiology, psychology, and
          sociology.<br><br>

          Like architecture on Earth, the attempt is to go beyond the component elements and systems and gain a broad
          understanding of the issues that affect design success. Space architecture borrows from multiple forms of
          niche architecture to accomplish the task of ensuring human beings can live and work in space. These include
          the kinds of design elements one finds in “tiny housing, small living apartments/houses, vehicle design,
          capsule hotels, and more.”<br><br>

          Much space architecture work has been in designing concepts for orbital space stations and lunar and Martian
          exploration ships and surface bases for the world's space agencies, chiefly NASA.<br><br>

          The practice of involving architects in the space program grew out of the Space Race, although its origins can
          be seen much earlier. The need for their involvement stemmed from the push to extend space mission durations
          and address the needs of astronauts including but beyond minimum survival needs. Space architecture is
          currently represented in several institutions. The Sasakawa International Center for Space Architecture
          (SICSA) is an academic organization with the University of Houston that offers a Master of Science in Space
          Architecture. SICSA also works design contracts with corporations and space agencies. In Europe, The Vienna
          University of Technology and the International Space University are involved in space architecture research.
          The International Conference on Environmental Systems meets annually to present sessions on human spaceflight
          and space human factors. Within the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the Space Architecture
          Technical Committee has been formed. Despite the historical pattern of large government-led space projects and
          university-level conceptual design, the advent of space tourism threatens to shift the outlook for space
          architecture work.</p>

        <h1 style="font-family:'Caesar Dressing', cursive;font-size: 50px;">Archaeoastronomy – The History of Human
          Understanding of the Universe</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Archaeoastronomy (also spelled archeoastronomy) is the
          interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary study of how people in the past "have understood the phenomena in
          the sky, how they used these phenomena and what role the sky played in their cultures". Clive Ruggles
          argues it is misleading to consider archaeoastronomy to be the study of ancient astronomy, as modern astronomy
          is a scientific discipline, while archaeoastronomy considers symbolically rich cultural interpretations of
          phenomena in the sky by other cultures. It is often twinned with ethnoastronomy, the anthropological
          study of skywatching in contemporary societies. Archaeoastronomy is also closely associated with historical
          astronomy, the use of historical records of heavenly events to answer astronomical problems and the history of
          astronomy, which uses written records to evaluate past astronomical practice.<br><br>

          Archaeoastronomy uses a variety of methods to uncover evidence of past practices including archaeology,
          anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use
          data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty
          for archaeoastronomers. Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in landscape archaeology and cognitive
          archaeology. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be
          integrated into beliefs about the cycles of nature, such as Mayan astronomy and its relationship with
          agriculture. Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of
          the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.<br><br>

          Archaeoastronomy can be applied to all cultures and all time periods. The meanings of the sky vary from
          culture to culture; nevertheless there are scientific methods which can be applied across cultures when
          examining ancient beliefs. It is perhaps the need to balance the social and scientific aspects of
          archaeoastronomy which led Clive Ruggles to describe it as "a field with academic work of high quality at one
          end but uncontrolled speculation bordering on lunacy at the other".</p>

            </h1>
            <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Anthropologists studying outer space might sound like fringe
              science, like something from “The X-Files” or some “ancient aliens” TV show, but we have been studying
              outer space as long as we’ve been studying people whose lives are influenced by it. In the fields of
              archaeoastronomy (how people understood the sky in the past) and ethnoastronomy (current cultural
              perceptions of the sky), scholars study how humans throughout history have looked up to the sky and
              wondered where we come from, why we’re here, and where we’re going. “All human cultures have a sky,” notes
              astronomer and archaeologist Clive Ruggles, and throughout human history our relationships with the cycles
              of stars and planets in that sky have influenced human activities, including agriculture, religion,
              literature, and art.</p>

              class="rounded-corners responsive"><br><Br>
            <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Today we not only look at the stars, we send spacecraft to
              investigate outer space and plan for human
              habitation on other worlds. The United States and the Soviet Union first sent animals up in rockets in the
              1940s, and in 1961 Yuri Gagarin became the first human to travel to space. By 1969, humans had walked on
              the moon. Soon after, anthropologists were discussing the problem of how to study emerging cultures of
              space—a place few people had even been to. In the 1970s, anthropologist and futurist Magoroh Maruyama
              organized a series of discussions on outer space at the annual American Anthropological Association
              meetings and the International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences. These meetings led
              to the publication of the 1975 book “Cultures Beyond the Earth: The Role of Anthropology in Outer
              Space.”<br><br>

              In the 1980s, anthropologist Ben Finney turned his eye to space. He combined his experience in the U.S.
              Navy and the aerospace industry with his anthropological research on how Polynesian people could have
              crossed the Pacific Ocean. In 1994 anthropologist Roland A. Foulkes drew from this earlier work by
              Maruyama, Finney, and other anthropologists in his essay “Why Space? An Anthropologist’s Response.”
              Foulkes even talked about possible names for the field of anthropology that studies space, suggesting
              astroanthropology, exoanthropology, aerospace-anthropology, or extraterrestrial anthropology.<br><br>

              The call for anthropologists to study outer space was revived in 2009 when anthropologists David
              Valentine, Valerie Olson, and Debbora Battaglia published a commentary in Anthropology News called
              “Encountering the Future: Anthropology and Outer Space.” Since “being earthbound is not a limitation” for
              humans, they argued, it shouldn’t be for anthropologists either.<br><br>

              Over the last decade, anthropologists studying space have written about dozens of topics, including the
              debate over Pluto’s status as a planet (Lisa Messeri, University of Virginia); how we respond to the
              threat of an asteroid hitting Earth (Valerie Olson, University of California, Irvine); the diaries kept by
              cosmonauts while they lived in space (Debbora Battaglia, Mount Holyoke College); new companies and
              communities in the private space-exploration industry (David Valentine, University of Minnesota); the
              search for extraterrestrial intelligence (Kathryn Denning, York University); and the science of studying
              extraterrestrial life (Stefan Helmreich, MIT).<br><br>

              There is even an archaeology of outer space. At Flinders University in Australia, archaeologist Alice
              Gorman studies the debris we leave in space, from old satellites orbiting the earth to spacecraft, robots,
              and even shadows on the moon. In her TED talk Gorman explains how the stuff we think of as useless “space
              junk” actually has value as part of our cultural heritage.<br><br>

              It takes imagination to think like this. Gorman uses her expertise in archaeology and anthropology to
              imagine how a piece of technology from our recent history could be an important artifact in the future.
              Work like this inspires me to wonder what human culture might look like in the future—in one hundred, one
              thousand, or even ten thousand years. This kind of future-aware anthropology draws from both science and
              science fiction. And in turn, science-fiction authors such as Ursula K. Le Guin, Octavia Butler, Samuel
              Delany, Phillip K. Dick, and Frank Herbert are all doing speculative anthropology when they use their
              knowledge of life here on Earth to write fictional works about people, cultures, and landscapes elsewhere
              and otherwise—on other worlds and in possible futures.
