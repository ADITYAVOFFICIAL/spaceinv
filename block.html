              <h2 style="font-family: 'Carter One', cursive;">What Is a Blockchain?</h2>
              <p style="font-family:'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;">A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared
                among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in
                digital format. Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as
                Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. The innovation with a
                blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust
                without the need for a trusted third party.

              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p style="font-family:'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;">One key difference between a typical database and a
            blockchain is how the data is structured. A
            blockchain collects information together in groups, known as blocks, that hold sets of information.
            Blocks have certain storage capacities and, when filled, are closed and linked to the previously filled
            block, forming a chain of data known as the blockchain. All new information that follows that freshly
            added block is compiled into a newly formed block that will then also be added to the chain once
            filled.<br><br>

            A database usually structures its data into tables, whereas a blockchain, like its name implies,
            structures its data into chunks (blocks) that are strung together. This data structure inherently makes
            an irreversible time line of data when implemented in a decentralized nature. When a block is filled, it
            is set in stone and becomes a part of this time line. Each block in the chain is given an exact time
            stamp when it is added to the chain.</p>

          </h2>
          <ul style="font-family:'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;">
            <li>Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way that it stores
              information; blockchains store data in blocks that are then linked together via cryptography.</li><br>
            <li>As new data comes in, it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data, it is
              chained onto the previous block, which makes the data chained together in chronological order.</li><br>
            <li>Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the most common use so far has been as
              a ledger for transactions. </li><br>
            <li>In Bitcoinâs case, blockchain is used in a decentralized way so that no single person or group has
              controlârather, all users collectively retain control.</li><br>

          </ul>
          <h2 style="font-family: 'Carter One', cursive;">How Does a Blockchain Work?</h2>
          <p style="font-family:'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;">The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to
            be recorded and distributed, but not edited. In this way, a blockchain is the foundation for immutable
            ledgers, or records of transactions that cannot be altered, deleted, or destroyed. This is why blockchains
            are also known as a distributed ledger technology (DLT).<br><br>

            First proposed as a research project in 1991,1 the blockchain concept predated its first widespread
            application in use: Bitcoin, in 2009. In the years since, the use of blockchains has exploded via the
            creation of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens
            (NFTs),
            and smart contracts.</p>

          <p style="font-family:'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;">Imagine that a company owns a server farm with 10,000
            computers used to maintain a database holding all of its clientâs account information. This company owns a
            warehouse building that contains all of these computers under one roof and has full control of each of these
            computers and all of the information contained within them. This, however, provides a single point of
            failure. What happens if the electricity at that location goes out? What if its Internet connection is
            severed? What if it burns to the ground? What if a bad actor erases everything with a single keystroke? In
            any case, the data is lost or corrupted.<br><br>

            What a blockchain does is to allow the data held in that database to be spread out among several network
            nodes at various locations. This not only creates redundancy but also maintains the fidelity of the data
            stored thereinâif somebody tries to alter a record at one instance of the database, the other nodes would
            not be altered and thus would prevent a bad actor from doing so. If one user tampers with Bitcoinâs record
            of transactions, all other nodes would cross-reference each other and easily pinpoint the node with the
            incorrect information. This system helps to establish an exact and transparent order of events. This way, no
            single node within the network can alter information held within it.<br><br>

            Because of this, the information and history (such as of transactions of a cryptocurrency) are irreversible.
            Such a record could be a list of transactions (such as with a cryptocurrency), but it also is possible for a
            blockchain to hold a variety of other information like legal contracts, state identifications, or a
            companyâs product inventory.</p>
          <code><strong> IMPORTANT :To validate new entries or records to a block, a majority of the decentralized networkâs computing power would need to agree to it. To prevent bad actors from validating bad transactions or double spends, blockchains are secured by a consensus mechanism such as proof of work (PoW) or proof of stake (PoS). These mechanisms allow for agreement even when no single node is in charge</strong></code>

          <h2 style="font-family: 'Carter One', cursive;">Transparency</h2>
          <p style="font-family:'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;">Because of the decentralized nature of Bitcoinâs
            blockchain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by either having a personal node or using
            blockchain explorers that allow anyone to see transactions occurring live. Each node has its own copy of the
            chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. This means that if you wanted to, you could
            track Bitcoin wherever it goes.<br><br>

            For example, exchanges have been hacked in the past, where those who kept Bitcoin on the exchange lost
            everything. While the hacker may be entirely anonymous, the Bitcoins that they extracted are easily
            traceable. If the Bitcoins stolen in some of these hacks were to be moved or spent somewhere, it would be
            known.<br><br>

            Of course, the records stored in the Bitcoin blockchain (as well as most others) are encrypted. This means
            that only the owner of a record can decrypt it to reveal their identity (using a public-private key pair).
            As a result, users of blockchains can remain anonymous while preserving transparency.</p>
          <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77aec2_ef577a7a6248432fb115ed49958303f0~mv2.png" alt=""
            class="rounded-corners">
          <h2 style="font-family: 'Carter One', cursive;">Is Blockchain Secure?
          </h2>
          <p style="font-family:'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;">Blockchain technology achieves decentralized security and
            trust in several ways. To begin with, new blocks are always stored linearly and chronologically. That is,
            they are always added to the âendâ of the blockchain. After a block has been added to the end of the
            blockchain, it is extremely difficult to go back and alter the contents of the block unless a majority of
            the network has reached a consensus to do so. Thatâs because each block contains its own hash, along with
            the hash of the block before it, as well as the previously mentioned time stamp. Hash codes are created by a
            mathematical function that turns digital information into a string of numbers and letters. If that
            information is edited in any way, then the hash code changes as well.<br><br>

            Letâs say that a hacker, who also runs a node on a blockchain network, wants to alter a blockchain and steal
            cryptocurrency from everyone else. If they were to alter their own single copy, it would no longer align
            with everyone elseâs copy. When everyone else cross-references their copies against each other, they would
            see this one copy stand out, and that hackerâs version of the chain would be cast away as
            illegitimate.<br><br>

            Succeeding with such a hack would require that the hacker simultaneously control and alter 51% or more of
            the copies of the blockchain so that their new copy becomes the majority copy and, thus, the agreed-upon
            chain. Such an attack would also require an immense amount of money and resources, as they would need to
            redo all of the blocks because they would now have different time stamps and hash codes.<br><br>

            Due to the size of many cryptocurrency networks and how fast they are growing, the cost to pull off such a
            feat probably would be insurmountable. This would be not only extremely expensive but also likely fruitless.
            Doing such a thing would not go unnoticed, as network members would see such drastic alterations to the
            blockchain. The network members would then hard fork off to a new version of the chain that has not been
            affected. This would cause the attacked version of the token to plummet in value, making the attack
            ultimately pointless, as the bad actor has control of a worthless asset. The same would occur if the bad
            actor were to attack the new fork of Bitcoin. It is built this way so that taking part in the network is far
            more economically incentivized than attacking it.</p>

            class="rounded-corners">
          <h2 style="font-family: 'Carter One', cursive;">Bitcoin vs. Blockchain
          </h2>
          <p style="font-family:'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;">Blockchain technology was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart
            Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, two researchers who wanted to implement a system where document time stamps
            could not be tampered with. But it wasnât until almost two decades later, with the launch of Bitcoin in
            January 2009, that blockchain had its first real-world application.<br><br>

            The Bitcoin protocol is built on a blockchain. In a research paper introducing the digital currency,
            Bitcoinâs pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, referred to it as âa new electronic cash system thatâs
            fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.â<br><br>

            The key thing to understand here is that Bitcoin merely uses blockchain as a means to transparently record a
            ledger of payments, but blockchain can, in theory, be used to immutably record any number of data points. As
            discussed above, this could be in the form of transactions, votes in an election, product inventories, state
            identifications, deeds to homes, and much more.<br><br>

            Currently, tens of thousands of projects are looking to implement blockchains in a variety of ways to help
            society other than just recording transactionsâfor example, as a way to vote securely in democratic
            elections. The nature of blockchainâs immutability means that fraudulent voting would become far more
            difficult to occur. For example, a voting system could work such that each citizen of a country would be
            issued a single cryptocurrency or token. Each candidate would then be given a specific wallet address, and
            the voters would send their token or crypto to the address of whichever candidate for whom they wish to
            vote. The transparent and traceable nature of blockchain would eliminate both the need for human vote
            counting and the ability of bad actors to tamper with physical ballots.</p>

            class="responsive">
          <h2 style="font-family: 'Carter One', cursive;">How Are Blockchains Used?

          </h2>
          <p style="font-family:'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;">As we now know, blocks on Bitcoinâs blockchain store data
            about monetary transactions. Today, there are more than 10,000 other cryptocurrency systems running on
            blockchain. But it turns out that blockchain is actually a reliable way of storing data about other types of
            transactions as well.<br><br>

            Some companies that have already incorporated blockchain include Walmart, Pfizer, AIG, Siemens, Unilever,
            and a host of others. For example, IBM has created its Food Trust blockchain to trace the journey that food
            products take to get to their locations.<br><br>

            Why do this? The food industry has seen countless outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella, and listeria, as well as
            hazardous materials being accidentally introduced to foods. In the past, it has taken weeks to find the
            source of these outbreaks or the cause of sickness from what people are eating. Using blockchain gives
            brands the ability to track a food productâs route from its origin, through each stop it makes, and finally,
            its delivery. If a food is found to be contaminated, then it can be traced all the way back through each
            stop to its origin. Not only that, but these companies can also now see everything else it may have come in
            contact with, allowing the identification of the problem to occur far sooner and potentially saving lives.
            This is one example of blockchain in practice, but there are many other forms of blockchain implementation.
          </p>
          <h2 style="font-family: 'Carter One', cursive;">Currency

          </h2>
          <p style="font-family:'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;">Blockchain forms the bedrock for cryptocurrencies like
            Bitcoin. The U.S. dollar is controlled by the Federal Reserve. Under this central authority system, a userâs
            data and currency are technically at the whim of their bank or government. If a userâs bank is hacked, the
            clientâs private information is at risk. If the clientâs bank collapses or the client lives in a country
            with an unstable government, the value of their currency may be at risk. In 2008, several failing banks were
            bailed outâpartially using taxpayer money. These are the worries out of which Bitcoin was first conceived
            and developed.<br><br>

            By spreading its operations across a network of computers, blockchain allows Bitcoin and other
            cryptocurrencies to operate without the need for a central authority. This not only reduces risk but also
            eliminates many of the processing and transaction fees. It can also give those in countries with unstable
            currencies or financial infrastructures a more stable currency with more applications and a wider network of
            individuals and institutions with whom they can do business, both domestically and internationally.<br><br>

            Using cryptocurrency wallets for savings accounts or as a means of payment is especially profound for those
            who have no state identification. Some countries may be war-torn or have governments that lack any real
            infrastructure to provide identification. Citizens of such countries may not have access to savings or
            brokerage accountsâand, therefore, no way to safely store wealth.</p><img
