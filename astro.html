        <h1 style="font-family:'Caesar Dressing', cursive;font-size: 50px;">What is Astronomy?</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Astronomy (from Greek: ἀστρονομία, literally meaning
          the science that studies the laws of the stars) is a natural science that studies celestial objects and
          phenomena. It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry in order to explain their origin and evolution. Objects
          of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, and comets. Relevant phenomena include supernova
          explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More
          generally, astronomy studies everything that originates beyond Earth's atmosphere. Cosmology is a branch of
          astronomy that studies the universe as a whole.<br><br>

          Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations in recorded history made methodical
          observations of the night sky. These include the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Chinese, Maya, and
          many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas. In the past, astronomy included disciplines as diverse as
          astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and the making of calendars. Nowadays, professional
          astronomy is often said to be the same as astrophysics.<br><br>

          Professional astronomy is split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy is
          focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects. This data is then analyzed using basic
          principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical
          models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. These two fields complement each other. Theoretical
          astronomy seeks to explain observational results and observations are used to confirm theoretical
          results.<br><br>

          Astronomy is one of the few sciences in which amateurs play an active role. This is especially true for the
          discovery and observation of transient events. Amateur astronomers have helped with many important
          discoveries, such as finding new comets.</p>

            <h1 style="font-family:'Bangers', cursive;">Observational astronomy</h1><br>
            <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Observational astronomy is a division of astronomy that is
              concerned with recording data about the observable universe, in contrast with theoretical astronomy, which
              is mainly concerned with calculating the measurable implications of physical models. It is the practice
              and study of observing celestial objects with the use of telescopes and other astronomical
              instruments.<br><br>

              As a science, the study of astronomy is somewhat hindered in that direct experiments with the properties
              of the distant universe are not possible. However, this is partly compensated by the fact that astronomers
              have a vast number of visible examples of stellar phenomena that can be examined. This allows for
              observational data to be plotted on graphs, and general trends recorded. Nearby examples of specific
              phenomena, such as variable stars, can then be used to infer the behavior of more distant representatives.
              Those distant yardsticks can then be employed to measure other phenomena in that neighborhood, including
              the distance to a galaxy.<br><br>

              Galileo Galilei turned a telescope to the heavens and recorded what he saw. Since that time, observational
              astronomy has made steady advances with each improvement in telescope technology.</p>

            <h1 style="font-family:'Bangers', cursive;">Astrometry</h1><br>
            <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Astrometry is a branch of astronomy that involves precise
              measurements of the positions and movements of stars and other celestial bodies. It provides the
              kinematics and physical origin of the Solar System and our galaxy, the Milky Way.<br><br>

              Apart from the fundamental function of providing astronomers with a reference frame to report their
              observations in, astrometry is also fundamental for fields like celestial mechanics, stellar dynamics and
              galactic astronomy. In observational astronomy, astrometric techniques help identify stellar objects by
              their unique motions. It is instrumental for keeping time, in that UTC is essentially the atomic time
              synchronized to Earth's rotation by means of exact astronomical observations. Astrometry is an important
              step in the cosmic distance ladder because it establishes parallax distance estimates for stars in the
              Milky Way.<br><br>

              Astrometry has also been used to support claims of extrasolar planet detection by measuring the
              displacement the proposed planets cause in their parent star's apparent position on the sky, due to their
              mutual orbit around the center of mass of the system. Astrometry is more accurate in space missions that
              are not affected by the distorting effects of the Earth's atmosphere. NASA's planned Space
              Interferometry Mission (SIM PlanetQuest) (now cancelled) was to utilize astrometric techniques to detect
              terrestrial planets orbiting 200 or so of the nearest solar-type stars. The European Space Agency's Gaia
              Mission, launched in 2013, applies astrometric techniques in its stellar census. In addition to the
              detection of exoplanets, it can also be used to determine their mass.<br><br>

              Astrometric measurements are used by astrophysicists to constrain certain models in celestial mechanics.
              By measuring the velocities of pulsars, it is possible to put a limit on the asymmetry of supernova
              explosions. Also, astrometric results are used to determine the distribution of dark matter in the
              galaxy.<br><br>

              Astronomers use astrometric techniques for the tracking of near-Earth objects. Astrometry is responsible
              for the detection of many record-breaking Solar System objects. To find such objects astrometrically,
              astronomers use telescopes to survey the sky and large-area cameras to take pictures at various determined
              intervals. By studying these images, they can detect Solar System objects by their movements relative to
              the background stars, which remain fixed. Once a movement per unit time is observed, astronomers
              compensate for the parallax caused by Earth's motion during this time and the heliocentric distance to
              this object is calculated. Using this distance and other photographs, more information about the object,
              including its orbital elements, can be obtained.<br><br>

              50000 Quaoar and 90377 Sedna are two Solar System objects discovered in this way by Michael E. Brown and
              others at Caltech using the Palomar Observatory's Samuel Oschin telescope of 48 inches (1.2 m) and the
              Palomar-Quest large-area CCD camera. The ability of astronomers to track the positions and movements of
              such celestial bodies is crucial to the understanding of the Solar System and its interrelated past,
              present, and future with others in the Universe.<br><br></p>

            <h1 style="font-family:'Bangers', cursive;">Amateur astronomy</h1><br>
            <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Amateur astronomy is a hobby where participants enjoy observing
              or imaging celestial objects in the sky using the unaided eye, binoculars, or telescopes. Even though
              scientific research may not be their primary goal, some amateur astronomers make contributions in doing
              citizen science, such as by monitoring variable stars, double stars, sunspots, or occultations of
              stars by the Moon or asteroids, or by discovering transient astronomical events, such as comets,
              galactic novae or supernovae in other galaxies.<br><br>

              Amateur astronomers do not use the field of astronomy as their primary source of income or support, and
              usually have no professional degree in astrophysics or advanced academic training in the subject. Most
              amateurs are hobbyists, while others have a high degree of experience in astronomy and may often assist
              and work alongside professional astronomers. Many astronomers have studied the sky throughout history
              in an amateur framework; however, since the beginning of the twentieth century, professional astronomy has
              become an activity clearly distinguished from amateur astronomy and associated activities.<br><br>

              Amateur astronomers typically view the sky at night, when most celestial objects and astronomical events
              are visible, but others observe during the daytime by viewing the Sun and solar eclipses. Some just look
              at the sky using nothing more than their eyes or binoculars, but more dedicated amateurs often use
              portable telescopes or telescopes situated in their private or club observatories. Amateurs can also join
              as members of amateur astronomical societies, which can advise, educate or guide them towards ways of
              finding and observing celestial objects. They can also promote the science of astronomy among the general
              public.<br><br>

              Collectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena. Common targets of
              amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, and a variety of
              deep sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Many amateurs like to specialise in
              observing particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them. One branch of
              amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of the night sky.
              Astrophotography has become more popular with the introduction of far easier to use equipment including,
              digital cameras, DSLR cameras and relatively sophisticated purpose built high quality CCD cameras.<br><br>

              Most amateur astronomers work at visible wavelengths, but a small minority experiment with wavelengths
              outside the visible spectrum. An early pioneer of radio astronomy was Grote Reber, an amateur astronomer
              who constructed the first purpose built radio telescope in the late 1930s to follow up on the discovery of
              radio wavelength emissions from space by Karl Jansky. Non-visual amateur astronomy includes the use of
              infrared filters on conventional telescopes, and also the use of radio telescopes. Some amateur
              astronomers use home-made radio telescopes, while others use radio telescopes that were originally built
              for astronomical research but have since been made available for use by amateurs. The One-Mile Telescope
              is one such example.</p>

            <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Theoretical astronomy is the use of analytical and computational
              models based on principles from physics and chemistry to describe and explain astronomical objects and
              astronomical phenomena. Theorists in astronomy endeavor to create theoretical models and from the results
              predict observational consequences of those models. The observation of a phenomenon predicted by a model
              allows astronomers to select between several alternate or conflicting models as the one best able to
              describe the phenomena.<br><br>

              Ptolemy's Almagest, although a brilliant treatise on theoretical astronomy combined with a practical
              handbook for computation, nevertheless includes many compromises to reconcile discordant observations.
              Modern theoretical astronomy is usually assumed to have begun with the work of Johannes Kepler
              (1571–1630), particularly with Kepler's laws. The history of the descriptive and theoretical aspects of
              the Solar System mostly spans from the late sixteenth century to the end of the nineteenth
              century.<br><br>

              Theoretical astronomy is built on the work of observational astronomy, astrometry, astrochemistry, and
              astrophysics. Astronomy was early to adopt computational techniques to model stellar and galactic
              formation and celestial mechanics. From the point of view of theoretical astronomy, not only must the
              mathematical expression be reasonably accurate but it should preferably exist in a form which is amenable
              to further mathematical analysis when used in specific problems. Most of theoretical astronomy uses
              Newtonian theory of gravitation, considering that the effects of general relativity are weak for most
              celestial objects. Theoretical astronomy does not attempt to predict the position, size and temperature of
              every object in the universe, but by and large has concentrated upon analyzing the apparently complex but
              periodic motions of celestial objects.</p>

            </h1><br>
            <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Astrophysics is a science that employs the methods and
              principles of physics and chemistry in the study of astronomical objects and phenomena. As one of
              the founders of the discipline said, Astrophysics "seeks to ascertain the nature of the heavenly bodies,
              rather than their positions or motions in space–what they are, rather than where they are." Among the
              subjects studied are the Sun, other stars, galaxies, extrasolar planets, the interstellar medium and the
              cosmic microwave background. Emissions from these objects are examined across all parts of the
              electromagnetic spectrum, and the properties examined include luminosity, density, temperature, and
              chemical composition. Because astrophysics is a very broad subject, astrophysicists apply concepts and
              methods from many disciplines of physics and chemistry, including classical mechanics, electromagnetism,
              statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and
              atomic and molecular physics.<br><br>

              In practice, modern astronomical research often involves a substantial amount of work in the realms of
              theoretical and observational physics. Some areas of study for astrophysicists include their attempts to
              determine the properties of dark matter, dark energy, black holes, and other celestial bodies; and the
              origin and ultimate fate of the universe. Topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include
              Solar System formation and evolution; stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation and evolution;
              magnetohydrodynamics; large-scale structure of matter in the universe; origin of cosmic rays; general
              relativity, special relativity, quantum and physical cosmology, including string cosmology and
              astroparticle physics.</p><code>

                  space-plasma physics, is the study of plasmas as they occur naturally in the Earth's upper atmosphere
                  (aeronomy) and within the Solar System. As such, it encompasses a far-ranging number of topics, such
                  as heliophysics which includes the solar physics of the Sun: the solar wind, planetary magnetospheres
                  and ionospheres, auroras, cosmic rays, and synchrotron radiation. Space physics is a fundamental part
                  of the study of space weather and has important implications in not only to understanding the
                  universe, but also for practical everyday life, including the operations of communications and weather
                  satellites.<br><br>

                <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Orbital mechanics or astrodynamics is the application of
                  ballistics and celestial mechanics to the practical problems concerning the motion of rockets and
                  other spacecraft. The motion of these objects is usually calculated from Newton's laws of motion and
                  law of universal gravitation. Orbital mechanics is a core discipline within space-mission design and
                  control.<br><br>

                  Celestial mechanics treats more broadly the orbital dynamics of systems under the influence of
                  gravity, including both spacecraft and natural astronomical bodies such as star systems, planets,
                  moons, and comets. Orbital mechanics focuses on spacecraft trajectories, including orbital maneuvers,
                  orbital plane changes, and interplanetary transfers, and is used by mission planners to predict the
                  results of propulsive maneuvers.<br><br>

                  General relativity is a more exact theory than Newton's laws for calculating orbits, and is sometimes
                  necessary for greater accuracy or in high-gravity situations (e.g. orbits near the Sun).</p><code>

            </h1>
            <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">The study of stars and stellar evolution is fundamental to our
              understanding of the Universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and
              theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior. Star formation occurs in
              dense regions of dust and gas, known as giant molecular clouds. When destabilized, cloud fragments can
              collapse under the influence of gravity, to form a protostar. A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region
              will trigger nuclear fusion, thus creating a main-sequence star.<br><br>

              Almost all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were created inside the cores of stars.<br><br>

              The characteristics of the resulting star depend primarily upon its starting mass. The more massive the
              star, the greater its luminosity, and the more rapidly it fuses its hydrogen fuel into helium in its core.
              Over time, this hydrogen fuel is completely converted into helium, and the star begins to evolve. The
              fusion of helium requires a higher core temperature. A star with a high enough core temperature will push
              its outer layers outward while increasing its core density. The resulting red giant formed by the
              expanding outer layers enjoys a brief life span, before the helium fuel in the core is in turn consumed.
              Very massive stars can also undergo a series of evolutionary phases, as they fuse increasingly heavier
              elements.<br><br>

              The final fate of the star depends on its mass, with stars of mass greater than about eight times the Sun
              becoming core collapse supernovae; while smaller stars blow off their outer layers and leave behind
              the inert core in the form of a white dwarf. The ejection of the outer layers forms a planetary
              nebula. The remnant of a supernova is a dense neutron star, or, if the stellar mass was at least three
              times that of the Sun, a black hole. Closely orbiting binary stars can follow more complex
              evolutionary paths, such as mass transfer onto a white dwarf companion that can potentially cause a
              supernova. Planetary nebulae and supernovae distribute the "metals" produced in the star by fusion to
              the interstellar medium; without them, all new stars (and their planetary systems) would be formed from
              hydrogen and helium alone.</p><code>

                </h2>
                <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">The Sun is the star at the centre of the Solar System. It is
                  a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in
                  its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared radiation. It
                  is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million
                  kilometres (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth,
                  and it accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three quarters of
                  the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller
                  quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon and iron.<br><br>

                  According to its spectral class, the Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V). As such, it is
                  informally, and not completely accurately, referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is closer to white
                  than yellow). It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse
                  of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center,
                  whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became
                  so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost
                  all stars form by this process.<br><br>

                  The Sun's core fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second, converting 4 million
                  tons of matter into energy every second as a result. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and
                  170,000 years to escape the core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat. When hydrogen fusion in
                  its core has diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its
                  core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand,
                  eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become
                  sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable –
                  but not for about five billion years. After this, it will shed its outer layers and become a dense
                  type of cooling star known as a white dwarf, and no longer produce energy by fusion, but still glow
                  and give off heat from its previous fusion.<br><br>

                  The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times. The Sun was
                  thought of by some cultures as a deity. The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are
                  the basis of some solar calendars. The predominant calendar in use today is the Gregorian calendar
                  which is based upon the standard 16th Century interpretation that the Sun's observed movement is
                  primarily due to it actually moving.</p><code>

              planetary geology (together with geochemistry and geophysics), cosmochemistry, atmospheric science,
              oceanography, hydrology, theoretical planetary science, glaciology, and exoplanetology. Allied
              disciplines include space physics, when concerned with the effects of the Sun on the bodies of the Solar
              System, and astrobiology.<br><br>

              There are interrelated observational and theoretical branches of planetary science. Observational research
              can involve combinations of space exploration, predominantly with robotic spacecraft missions using remote
              sensing, and comparative, experimental work in Earth-based laboratories. The theoretical component
              involves considerable computer simulation and mathematical modelling.<br><br>

              Planetary scientists are generally located in the astronomy and physics or Earth sciences departments of
              universities or research centres, though there are several purely planetary science institutes worldwide.
              There are several major conferences each year, and a wide range of peer-reviewed journals. Some planetary
              scientists work at private research centres and often initiate partnership research tasks.</p><code>

              </h2>
              <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Planetary geology, alternatively known as astrogeology or
                exogeology, is a planetary science discipline concerned with the geology of the celestial bodies such as
                the planets and their moons, asteroids, comets, and meteorites. Although the geo- prefix typically
                indicates topics of or relating to Earth, planetary geology is named as such for historical and
                convenience reasons; due to the types of investigations involved, it is closely linked with Earth-based
                geology.<br><br>

                Planetary geology includes such topics as determining the internal structure of the terrestrial planets,
                and also looks at planetary volcanism and surface processes such as impact craters, fluvial and aeolian
                processes. The structures and compositions of the giant planets and their moons are also examined, as is
                the make-up of the minor bodies of the Solar System, such as asteroids, the Kuiper Belt, and comets.
                Planetary geology includes applications derived from other closely related fields within in the
                geological sciences, such as geophysics and geochemistry.

            </h1>
            <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Galactic astronomy is the study of the Milky Way galaxy and
              all its contents. This is in contrast to extragalactic astronomy, which is the study of everything
              outside our galaxy, including all other galaxies.<br><br>

              Galactic astronomy should not be confused with galaxy formation and evolution, which is the general
              study of galaxies, their formation, structure, components, dynamics, interactions, and the range of
              forms they take.<br><br>

              The Milky Way galaxy, where the Solar System belongs, is in many ways the best-studied galaxy, although
              important parts of it are obscured from view in visible wavelengths by regions of cosmic dust. The
              development of radio astronomy, infrared astronomy and submillimetre astronomy in the 20th Century
              allowed the gas and dust of the Milky Way to be mapped for the first time.</p><code>

            </h1>
            <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Extragalactic astronomy is the branch of astronomy concerned
              with objects outside the Milky Way galaxy. In other words, it is the study of all astronomical objects
              which are not covered by galactic astronomy.<br><br>

              The closest objects in extragalactic astronomy include the galaxies of the Local Group, which are close
              enough to allow very detailed analyses of their contents (e.g. supernova remnants, stellar associations).
              As instrumentation has improved, distant objects can now be examined in more detail and so extragalactic
              astronomy includes objects at nearly the edge of the observable universe. Research into distant
              galaxies (outside of our local group) is valuable for studying aspects of the universe such as galaxy
              evolution and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) which give insight into physical phenomena (e.g. super
              massive black hole accretion and the presence of dark matter). It is through extragalactic astronomy
              that astronomers and physicists are able to study the effects of General Relativity such as
              gravitational lensing and gravitational waves, that are otherwise impossible (or nearly impossible)
              to study on a galactic scale.</p><code>

            </h1>
            <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Physical cosmology is a branch of cosmology concerned with the
              study of cosmological models. A cosmological model, or simply cosmology, provides a description of the
              largest-scale structures and dynamics of the universe and allows study of fundamental questions about its
              origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican
              principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and
              Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed those physical laws to be understood.<br><br>

              Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's
              general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin
              Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond the Milky Way;
              then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it
              possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang
              theory, by Georges Lemaître, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful
              of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory best explains the
              observations.<br><br>

              Dramatic advances in observational cosmology since the 1990s, including the cosmic microwave background,
              distant supernovae and galaxy redshift surveys, have led to the development of a standard model of
              cosmology. This model requires the universe to contain large amounts of dark matter and dark energy whose
              nature is currently not well understood, but the model gives detailed predictions that are in excellent
              agreement with many diverse observations.<br><br>

              Cosmology draws heavily on the work of many disparate areas of research in theoretical and applied
              physics. Areas relevant to cosmology include particle physics experiments and theory, theoretical and
              observational astrophysics, general relativity, quantum mechanics, and plasma physics.</p><code>
