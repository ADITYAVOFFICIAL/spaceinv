        <h1 style="font-family:'Caesar Dressing', cursive;font-size: 50px;">What is Astronautics?</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Astronautics (or cosmonautics) is the theory and practice of travel
          beyond Earth's atmosphere into outer space. Spaceflight is one of its main applications and space science its
          overarching field.<br><br>

          The term astronautics (originally astronautique in French) was coined in the 1920s by J.-H. Rosny, president
          of the Goncourt academy, in analogy with aeronautics. Because there is a degree of technical overlap
          between the two fields, the term aerospace is often used to describe both at once. In 1930, Robert
          Esnault-Pelterie published the first book on the new research field.<br><br>

          The term cosmonautics (originally cosmonautique in French) was introduced in 1930s by Ary Sternfeld with his
          book Initiation à la Cosmonautique (Introduction to cosmonautics) (the book brought him the Prix
          REP-Hirsch, later known as the Prix d'Astronautique, of the French Astronomical Society in 1934.)<br><br>

          As with aeronautics, the restrictions of mass, temperatures, and external forces require that applications in
          space survive extreme conditions: high-grade vacuum, the radiation bombardment of interplanetary space and the
          magnetic belts of low Earth orbit. Space launch vehicles must withstand titanic forces, while satellites can
          experience huge variations in temperature in very brief periods. Extreme constraints on mass cause
          astronautical engineers to face the constant need to save mass in the design in order to maximize the actual
          payload that reaches orbit.</p>

        <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Aerospace – comprises the atmosphere of Earth and surrounding space.
          Typically the term is used to refer to the aerospace industry, which researches, designs, manufactures,
          operates, and maintains vehicles moving through air and space. The aerospace field is diverse, with a
          multitude of commercial, industrial, and military applications.</p><br>
        <h1 style="font-family:'Caesar Dressing', cursive;font-size: 50px;">Aerospace Engineering
        </h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Aerospace engineering is the primary field of engineering concerned
          with the development of aircraft and
          spacecraft. It has two major and overlapping branches: aeronautical engineering and astronautical
          engineering. Avionics engineering is similar, but deals with the electronics side of aerospace
          engineering.<br><br>

          "Aeronautical engineering" was the original term for the field. As flight technology advanced to include
          vehicles operating in outer space, the broader term "aerospace engineering" has come into use. Aerospace
          engineering, particularly the astronautics branch, is often colloquially referred to as "rocket science".</p>

            </h1><br>
            <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Aeronautics is the science or art involved with the study,
              design, and manufacturing of air flight–capable machines, and the techniques of operating aircraft and
              rockets within the atmosphere. The British Royal Aeronautical Society identifies the aspects of
              "aeronautical Art, Science and Engineering" and "The profession of Aeronautics (which expression includes
              Astronautics)."<br><br>

              While the term originally referred solely to operating the aircraft, it has since been expanded to include
              technology, business, and other aspects related to aircraft. The term "aviation" is sometimes used
              interchangeably with aeronautics, although "aeronautics" includes lighter-than-air craft such as airships,
              and includes ballistic vehicles while "aviation" technically does not.<br><br>

              A significant part of aeronautical science is a branch of dynamics called aerodynamics, which deals with
              the motion of air and the way that it interacts with objects in motion, such as an aircraft.</p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Spaceflight (or space flight) is an application of
                astronautics to fly spacecraft into or through outer space, either with or without humans on board. Most
                spaceflight is uncrewed and conducted mainly with spacecraft such as satellites in orbit around Earth,
                but also includes space probes for flights beyond Earth orbit. Such spaceflight operates either by
                telerobotic or autonomous control. The more complex human spaceflight has been pursued soon after the
                first orbital satellites and has reached the Moon and permanent human presence in space around Earth,
                particularly with the use of space stations. Human spaceflight programs include the Soyuz, Shenzhou, the
                past Apollo Moon landing and the Space Shuttle programs, with currently the International Space Station
                as the main destination of human spaceflight missions while China's Tiangong Space Station is under
                construction.<br><br>

                Spaceflight is used for placing in Earth's orbit communications satellites, reconnaissance satellites,
                Earth observation satellites, but also for space exploration such as space observatories and space
                probes, or even for space tourism.<br><br>

                Spaceflight can be achieved with different types of launch systems, conventionally by rocket launching,
                which provide the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propel a spacecraft from the
                surface of the Earth. Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft – both when unpropelled and when under
                propulsion – is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics.<br><br>

                Some spacecraft remain in space practically indefinitely, which has created the issue of space pollution
                in the form of light pollution and space junk, which is a hazard to spaceflight. Otherwise spacecraft
                are terminated by atmospheric reentry, in which they disintegrate, or if they do not, their reentry is
                mostly controlled to safely reach a surface by landing or impacting, often being dumped in the oceanic
                spacecraft cemetery. As such spacecraft have been the subject of some space traffic management.</p>

                  <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Human spaceflight (also referred to as manned spaceflight
                    or
                    crewed spaceflight) is spaceflight with a crew or passengers aboard a spacecraft, often with the
                    spacecraft being operated directly by the onboard human crew. Spacecraft can also be remotely
                    operated
                    from ground stations on Earth, or autonomously, without any direct human involvement. People trained
                    for spaceflight are called astronauts (American or other), cosmonauts (Russian), or taikonauts
                    (Chinese); and non-professionals are referred to as spaceflight participants or
                    spacefarers.[citation

                    The first human in space was Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, who launched on 12 April 1961 as part of
                    the Soviet Union's Vostok program. This was towards the beginning of the Space Race. On 5 May 1961,
                    Alan Shepard became the first American in space, as part of Project Mercury. Humans traveled to the
                    Moon nine times between 1968 and 1972 as part of the United States' Apollo program, and have had a
                    continuous presence in space for 21 years and 68 days on the International Space Station (ISS).
                    As
                    of 2021, humans have not traveled beyond low Earth orbit since the Apollo 17 lunar mission in
                    December
                    1972.<br><br>

                    Currently, the United States, Russia, and China are the only countries with public or commercial
                    human
                    spaceflight-capable programs. On 15 October 2003, the first Chinese taikonaut, Yang Liwei, went to
                    space as part of Shenzhou 5. Non-governmental spaceflight companies have been working to develop
                    human
                    space programs of their own, e.g. for space tourism or commercial in-space research. The first
                    private
                    human spaceflight launch was a suborbital flight on SpaceShipOne on June 21, 2004. The first
                    commercial orbital crew launch was by SpaceX in May 2020, transporting, under United States
                    government
                    contract, NASA astronauts to the ISS.</p><code>

                      <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Bioastronautics is a specialty area of biological and
                        astronautical research which encompasses numerous aspects of biological, behavioral, and medical
                        concern governing humans and other living organisms in a space flight environment; and includes
                        design of payloads, space habitats, and life-support systems. In short, it spans the study and
                        support of life in space.<br><br>

                        Bioastronautics includes many similarities with its sister discipline astronautical hygiene;
                        they both study the hazards that humans may encounter during a space flight. However,
                        astronautical hygiene differs in many respects e.g. in this discipline, once a hazard is
                        identified, the exposure risks are then assessed and the most effective measures determined to
                        prevent or control exposure and thereby protect the health of the astronaut. Astronautical
                        hygiene is an applied scientific discipline that requires knowledge and experience of many
                        fields including bioastronautics, space medicine, ergonomics etc. The skills of astronautical
                        hygiene are already being applied for example, to characterise moon dust and design the measures
                        to mitigate exposure during lunar exploration, to develop accurate chemical monitoring
                        techniques and use the results in the setting SMACs.<br><br>

                        Of particular interest from a biological perspective are the effects of reduced gravitational
                        force felt by inhabitants of spacecraft. Often referred to as "microgravity", the lack of
                        sedimentation, buoyancy, or convective flows in fluids results in a more quiescent cellular and
                        intercellular environment primarily driven by chemical gradients. Certain functions of organisms
                        are mediated by gravity, such as gravitropism in plant roots and negative gravitropism in plant
                        stems, and without this stimulus growth patterns of organisms onboard spacecraft often diverge
                        from their terrestrial counterparts. Additionally, metabolic energy normally expended in
                        overcoming the force of gravity remains available for other functions. This may take the form of
                        accelerated growth in organisms as diverse as worms like C. elegans to miniature parasitoid
                        wasps such as Spangia endius. It may also be used in the augmented production of secondary
                        metabolites such as the vinca alkaloids Vincristine and Vinblastine in the rosy periwinkle
                        (Catharanthus roseus), whereby space grown specimens often have higher concentrations of these
                        constituents that on earth are present in only trace amounts.<br><br>

                        From an engineering perspective, facilitating the delivery and exchange of air, food, and water,
                        and the processing of waste products is also challenging. The transition from expendable
                        physicochemical methods to sustainable bioregenerative systems that function as a robust
                        miniature ecosystem is another goal of bioastronautics in facilitating long duration space
                        travel. Such systems are often termed Closed Ecological Life Support Systems (CELSS).<br><br>

                        From a medical perspective, long duration space flight also has physiological impacts on
                        astronauts. Accelerated bone decalcification, similar to osteopenia and osteoporosis on Earth,
                        is just one such condition. Study of these effects is useful not only in advancing methods
                        for safe habitation of and travel through space, but also in uncovering ways to more effectively
                        treat the related terrestrial ailments.<br><br>

                        NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas maintains a Bioastronautics Library (map[dead
                        link]). The one-room facility provides a collection of textbooks, reference books, conference
                        proceedings, and academic journals related to bioastronautics topics. Because the library is
                        located within secure government property (not part of Space Center Houston, the official
                        visitors center of JSC), it is not generally accessible to the public.</p><code>

                      </h1><br>
                      <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Space architecture is the theory and practice of
                        designing and building inhabited environments in outer space. This mission statement for
                        space architecture was developed at the World Space Congress in Houston in 2002 by members of
                        the Technical Aerospace Architecture Subcommittee of the American Institute of Aeronautics and
                        Astronautics (AIAA). The architectural approach to spacecraft design addresses the total built
                        environment. It is mainly based on the field of engineering (especially aerospace engineering),
                        but also involves diverse disciplines such as physiology, psychology, and sociology.<br><br>

                        Like architecture on Earth, the attempt is to go beyond the component elements and systems and
                        gain a broad understanding of the issues that affect design success. Space architecture
                        borrows from multiple forms of niche architecture to accomplish the task of ensuring human
                        beings can live and work in space. These include the kinds of design elements one finds in “tiny
                        housing, small living apartments/houses, vehicle design, capsule hotels, and more.”<br><br>

                        Much space architecture work has been in designing concepts for orbital space stations and lunar
                        and Martian exploration ships and surface bases for the world's space agencies, chiefly
                        NASA.<br><br>

                        The practice of involving architects in the space program grew out of the Space Race, although
                        its origins can be seen much earlier. The need for their involvement stemmed from the push to
                        extend space mission durations and address the needs of astronauts including but beyond minimum
                        survival needs. Space architecture is currently represented in several institutions. The
                        Sasakawa International Center for Space Architecture (SICSA) is an academic organization with
                        the University of Houston that offers a Master of Science in Space Architecture. SICSA also
                        works design contracts with corporations and space agencies.<br><br> In Europe, The Vienna
                        University of
                        Technology and the International Space University are involved in space architecture research.
                        The International Conference on Environmental Systems meets annually to present sessions on
                        human spaceflight and space human factors. Within the American Institute of Aeronautics and
                        Astronautics, the Space Architecture Technical Committee has been formed. Despite the historical
                        pattern of large government-led space projects and university-level conceptual design, the
                        advent of space tourism threatens to shift the outlook for space architecture work.</p><code>

                          </h1><br>
                          <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">A life-support system is the combination of
                            equipment that allows survival in an environment or situation that would not support that
                            life in its absence. It is generally applied to systems supporting human life in situations
                            where the outside environment is hostile, such as in space or underwater, or medical
                            situations where the health of the person is compromised to the extent that the risk of
                            death would be high without the function of the equipment.<br><br>

                            In human spaceflight, a life-support system is a group of devices that allow a human being
                            to survive in space. US government space agency NASA, and private spaceflight companies
                            use the term environmental control and life-support system or the acronym ECLSS when
                            describing these systems. The life-support system may supply air, water and food. It must
                            also maintain the correct body temperature, an acceptable pressure on the body and deal with
                            the body's waste products. Shielding against harmful external influences such as radiation
                            and micro-meteorites may also be necessary. Components of the life-support system are
                            life-critical, and are designed and constructed using safety engineering techniques.<br><br>

                            In underwater diving, the breathing apparatus is considered to be life support equipment,
                            and a saturation diving system is considered a life-support system – the personnel who are
                            responsible for operating it are called life support technicians. The concept can also be
                            extended to submarines, crewed submersibles and atmospheric diving suits, where the
                            breathing gas requires treatment to remain respirable, and the occupants are isolated from
                            the outside ambient pressure and temperature.<br><br>

                            Medical life-support systems include heart-lung machines, medical ventilators and dialysis
                            equipment.</p><code>

                            or an orbital space station, is a spacecraft capable of supporting a human crew in orbit for
                            an extended period of time, and is therefore a type of space habitat. It lacks major
                            propulsion or landing systems. Stations must have docking ports to allow other spacecraft to
                            dock to transfer crew and supplies.<br><br>

                            The purpose of maintaining an orbital outpost varies depending on the program. Space
                            stations have most often been launched for scientific purposes, but military launches have
                            also occurred. As of 2022, there is one fully operational and permanently inhabited space
                            station in low Earth orbit: the International Space Station (ISS), which is used to study
                            the effects of spaceflight on the human body as well as to provide a location to conduct a
                            greater number and longer length of scientific studies than is possible on other space
                            vehicles. China's Tiangong Space Station is under construction. Both India and Russia have
                            proposed to build stations for the coming decades.</p><code>

              </h1>
              <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Human presence in space is about humanity in space,
                particularly about all anthropogenic presence in space and human activity in space, that is in outer
                space and in a broader sense also on any extraterrestrial astronomical body.<br><br>

                Humans have been present in space either, in the common sense, through their direct presence and
                activity like human spaceflight, or through mediation of their presence and activity like with
                uncrewed spaceflight, making "telepresence" possible. Human presence in space, particularly through
                mediation, can take many physical forms from space debris, uncrewed spacecraft, artificial satellites,
                space observatories, crewed spacecraft, art in space, to human outposts in outer space such as space
                stations. While human presence in space, particularly its continuation and permanence can be a goal in
                itself, human presence can have a range of purposes and modes from space exploration, commercial
                use of space to space settlement or even colonization and militarisation of space. Human presence in
                space is realized and sustained through the advancement and application of space sciences,
                particularly astronautics in the form of spaceflight and space infrastructure.<br><br>

                Humans have achieved some mediated presence throughout the Solar System, but the most extensive
                presence has been in orbit around Earth. Humans have sustained direct presence in orbit around Earth
                since the year 2000 through continuously crewing the ISS, and with few interruptions through crewing
                the space station Mir since the later 1980s. The increasing and extensive human presence in orbital
                space around Earth, beside its benefits, has also produced a threat to it by carrying with it space
                debris, potentially cascading into the so-called Kessler syndrome. This has raised the need for
                regulation and mitigation of such to secure a sustainable access to outer space.<br><br>

                Securing the access to space and human presence in space has been pursued and allowed by the
                establishment of space law and space industry, creating a space infrastructure. But sustainability has
                remained a challenging goal, with the United Nations seeing the need to advance long-term
                sustainability of outer space activities in space science and application, and the United States
                having it as a crucial goal of its contemporary space policy and space program.</p>

              </h1>
              <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Women in space have been present and active since the
                beginning of human spaceflight. Since then a considerable number of women from a range of countries
                have worked in space, though overall women are still significantly less often chosen to go to space
                than men and represent by 2020 only 10% of all astronauts who have been to space.<br><br>

                The first women ever to enter space was Valentina Tereshkova, a former textile-factory assembly worker
                from the Yaroslavl Region in the Soviet Union. By October 2021 most of the 70 women who have been
                to space, have been United States citizens, with missions on the Space Shuttle and on the
                International Space Station. Other countries have had one (United Kingdom, France, South Korea, Italy)
                or two (USSR, Canada, Japan, Russia, China) women citizens in space, taking part in missions of
                programs with human spaceflight capability. Additionally one dual Iranian-US woman citizen has
                participated as tourist on a US mission.<br><br>

                Women face many of the same physical and psychological difficulties of spaceflight as men. Scientific
                studies generally show no particular adverse effect from short space missions. It has even been
                concluded that women might be better suited for longer space missions. The main obstacle for women
                to go to space remains gender discrimination.</p><code>

              </h1>
              <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Animals in space originally served to test the survivability
                of spaceflight, before human spaceflights were attempted. Later, other non-human animals were flown to
                investigate various biological processes and the effects microgravity and space flight might have on
                them. Bioastronautics is an area of bioengineering research which spans the study and support of life in
                space. To date, seven national space programs have flown animals into space: the Soviet Union, United
                States, France, Argentina, China, Japan and Iran.<br><br>

                A wide variety of animals have been launched into space, including monkeys and apes, dogs, cats,
                tortoises, mice, rats, rabbits, fish, frogs, spiders, and insects. The US launched flights carrying
                primates primarily between 1948 and 1961, with one flight in 1969 and one in 1985. France launched two
                monkey-carrying flights in 1967. The Soviet Union and Russia launched monkeys between 1983 and 1996.
                During the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet space program used a number of dogs for sub-orbital and orbital
                space flights.<br><br>

                Two tortoises and a variety of insects were the first inhabitants of Earth to circle the Moon, on the
                1968 Zond 5 mission. In 1972 five mice, Fe, Fi, Fo, Fum, and Phooey, orbited the Moon a record 75 times
                in Apollo 17's Command Module America, the last crewed voyage to the Moon.</p><code>

                  <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Félicette (French pronunciation: ​[fe.liː.sɛt]) was a
                    stray
                    Parisian cat who was the only cat successfully launched into space. She was launched on 18 October
                    1963
                    as part of the French space program. Félicette was one of 14 female cats trained for spaceflight.
                    The
                    cats had electrodes implanted onto their skulls so their neurological activity could be monitored
                    throughout the flight. Electrical impulses were applied to the brain and a leg during the flight to
                    stimulate responses. The capsule was recovered 13 minutes after the rocket was ignited. Most of the
                    data
                    from the mission were of good quality, and Félicette survived the flight. A second feline was killed
                    in
                    a launch mishap on 24 October 1963.<br><br>

                    Félicette had the designation of C 341 before the flight, and after the flight the media gave her
                    the
                    name Félix, after Félix the Cat. Centre d'Enseignement et de Recherches de Médecine Aéronautique
                    (CERMA)
                    modified this to the feminine Félicette and adopted it as her official name. She has been
                    commemorated
                    on postage stamps around the world and a statue with her likeness is on display at the International
                    Space University. France's feline biological rocket payloads were preceded by rats and followed by
                    monkeys.</p><code>

                  <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">During the 1950s and 1960s the Soviet space program used
                    dogs
                    for sub-orbital and orbital space flights to determine whether human spaceflight was feasible. In
                    this
                    period, the Soviet Union launched missions with passenger slots for at least 57 dogs. The number of
                    dogs
                    in space is smaller, as some dogs flew more than once. Most survived; the few that died were lost
                    mostly
                    through technical failures, according to the parameters of the test.<br><br>

                    A notable exception is Laika, the first animal to be sent into orbit, whose death during the 3
                    November,

                  <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Fe, Fi, Fo, Fum, and Phooey were five mice who traveled to
                    the
                    Moon and circled it 75 times on the 1972 Apollo 17 mission. NASA gave them identification numbers
                    A3305,
                    A3326, A3352, A3356, and A3400, and their nicknames were given by the Apollo 17 crew, Eugene Cernan,
                    Harrison Schmitt, and Ronald Evans. The four male mice, one female mouse, and Evans orbited the Moon
                    for
                    six days and four hours in the Apollo command module America as Cernan and Schmitt performed the
                    Apollo
                    program's last lunar excursions.<br><br>

                    The mice travelled in individual compartments of tubes inside an aluminium container with "a
                    sufficient
                    food supply, temperature control, and a reserve of potassium superoxide that absorbed the CO2 from
                    their
                    respiration and provided them with fresh oxygen." One of the male mice died (A-3352) during the
                    trip, and the four survivors were killed and dissected for their intended biological information
                    upon
                    their return from the Moon.<br><br>

                    The three astronauts and the five mice were the last Earthlings to travel to and orbit the Moon.
                    Evans and the five mice share two living-being spaceflight records: the longest amount of time spent
                    in
                    lunar orbit (147 hours 43 minutes), and the most lunar orbits traveled (75).</p><code>

                    animals were launched into space, including numerous other primates, so that scientists could
                    investigate the biological effects of spaceflight. The United States launched flights containing
                    primate
                    passengers primarily between 1948 and 1961 with one flight in 1969 and one in 1985. France launched
                    two
                    monkey-carrying flights in 1967. The Soviet Union and Russia launched monkeys between 1983 and 1996.
                    Most primates were anesthetized before lift-off.<br><br>

                    Overall, thirty-two non-human primates flew in the space program; none flew more than once. Numerous
                    backup primates also went through the programs but never flew. Monkeys and apes from several species
                    were used, including rhesus macaque, crab-eating macaque, squirrel monkeys, pig-tailed macaques, and
                    chimpanzees.</p><code>

                  </h1>
                  <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Zond 5 (Russian: Зонд 5, lit. 'Probe 5') was a spacecraft
                    of
                    the Soviet Zond program. In September 1968 it became the second spaceship to travel to and circle
                    the
                    Moon, and the first to return safely to Earth. Zond 5 carried the first terrestrial organisms to the
                    vicinity of the Moon, including two tortoises, fruit fly eggs, and plants. The tortoises underwent
                    biological changes during the flight, but it was concluded that the changes were primarily due to
                    starvation and that they were little affected by space travel.<br><br>

                    The Zond spacecraft was a version of the Soyuz 7K-L1 crewed lunar-flyby spacecraft. It was launched
                    by a
                    Proton-K carrier rocket with a Block D upper-stage to conduct scientific studies during its lunar
                    flyby.

                  </h1>
                  <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">The survival of some microorganisms exposed to outer space
                    has
                    been studied using both simulated facilities and low Earth orbit exposures. Bacteria were some of
                    the
                    first organisms investigated, when in 1960 a Russian satellite carried Escherichia coli,
                    Staphylococcus,
                    and Enterobacter aerogenes into orbit. Many kinds of microorganisms have been selected for exposure
                    experiments since, as listed in the table below.<br><br>

                    Experiments of the adaption of microbes in space have yielded unpredictable results. While sometimes
                    the
                    microorganism may weaken, they can also increase in their disease-causing potency.<br><br>

                    It is possible to classify these microorganisms into two groups, the human-borne and the
                    extremophiles.
                    Studying the human-borne microorganisms is significant for human welfare and future crewed missions
                    in
                    space, whilst the extremophiles are vital for studying the physiological requirements of survival in
                    space. NASA has pointed out that normal adults have ten times as many microbial cells as human cells
                    in their bodies. They are also nearly everywhere in the environment and, although normally
                    invisible,
                    can form slimy biofilms.<br><br>

                    Extremophiles have adapted to live in some of the most extreme environments on Earth. This includes
                    hypersaline lakes, arid regions, deep sea, acidic sites, cold and dry polar regions and permafrost.
                    The existence of extremophiles has led to the speculation that microorganisms could survive the
                    harsh
                    conditions of extraterrestrial environments and be used as model organisms to understand the fate of
                    biological systems in these environments. The focus of many experiments has been to investigate the
                    possible survival of organisms inside rocks (lithopanspermia), or their survival on Mars for
                    understanding the likelihood of past or present life on that planet. Because of their ubiquity and
                    resistance to spacecraft decontamination, bacterial spores are considered likely potential forward
                    contaminants on robotic missions to Mars. Measuring the resistance of such organisms to space
                    conditions
                    can be applied to develop adequate decontamination procedures.<br><br>

                    Research and testing of microorganisms in outer space could eventually be applied for directed
                    panspermia or terraforming.</p><code>

              <h1 style="font-family:'Bangers', cursive;">Plants in space
              </h1>
              <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">The growth of plants in outer space has elicited much
                scientific interest. In the late 20th and early 21st century, plants were often taken into space in
                low Earth orbit to be grown in a weightless but pressurized controlled environment, sometimes called
                space gardens. In the context of human spaceflight, they can be consumed as food and/or provide a
                refreshing atmosphere. Plants can metabolize carbon dioxide in the air to produce valuable oxygen,
                and can help control cabin humidity. Growing plants in space may provide a psychological benefit to
                human spaceflight crews. Usually the plants were part of studies or technical development to further
                develop space gardens or conduct science experiments. To date plants taken into space have had mostly
                scientific interest, with only limited contributions to the functionality of the spacecraft, however the
                Apollo Moon tree project was more or less forestry inspired mission and the trees part of a country's
                bicentennial celebration.<br><br>

                The first challenge in growing plants in space is how to get plants to grow without gravity. This
                runs into difficulties regarding the effects of gravity on root development, providing appropriate types
                of lighting, and other challenges. In particular, the nutrient supply to root as well as the nutrient
                biogeochemical cycles, and the microbiological interactions in soil-based substrates are particularly
                complex, but have been shown to make possible space farming in hypo- and micro-gravity.<br><br>

                NASA plans to grow plants in space to help feed astronauts, and to provide psychological benefits for
                long-term space flight. In 2017, aboard ISS in one plant growth device, the 5th crop of Chinese
                cabbage (Brassica rapa) from it included an allotment for crew consumption, while the rest was saved for
                study. An early discussion of plants in space, were the trees on the brick moon space station, in the
                1869 short story "The Brick Moon".</p><code>

          <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Space, particularly microgravity, make life different to life on
            Earth. Mundane needs such as air,
            pressure, temperature and light, as well as movement, hygiene and food intake are confronted with
            challenges.<br><br>

            Human health is mostly effected by long-duration stays particularly by the prevalent radiation exposure and
            the health effects of microgravity. Human fatalities have been the case due to accidents during spaceflight,
            particularly at launch and reentry. With the last in-flight accident killing humans, the Columbia accident
            in 2003, the sum of in-flight fatalities has risen to 15 astronauts and 4 cosmonauts, in five separate
            incidents. Over 100 others have died in accidents during activity directly related to spaceflight or
            testing.</p><code>

              </h1>
              <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Human space activity, and its subsequent presence, can and has
                been having an impact on space as well as on the capacity to access it. This impact of human space
                activity and presence, or its potential, has created the need to address its issues regarding planetary
                protection, space debris, nuclear hazards, radio pollution and light pollution, to the reusability of
                launch systems, for space not to become a sacrifice zone.<br><br>

                Sustainability has been a goal of space law, space technology and space infrastructure, with the United
                Nations seeing the need to advance long-term sustainability of outer space activities in space science
                and application, and the United States having it as a crucial goal of its contemporary space policy
                and space program.<br><br>

                Human presence in space is particularly being felt in orbit around Earth. The orbital space around Earth
                has seen increasing and extensive human presence, beside its benefits it has also produced a threat to
                it by carrying with it space debris, potentially cascading into the so-called Kessler syndrome. This
                has raised the need for regulation and mitigation of such to secure a sustainable access to outer space.

                pre-history in developing their perception of space above the ground, or the cosmos at large, and
                developing their place in it.<br><br>

                Social sciences have been studying such works of people from pre-history to the contemporary with the
                fields of archaeoastronomy to cultural astronomy. With actual human activity and presence in space the
                need for fields like astrosociology and space archaeology have been added.</p>

                    spaceflight, resulting in a dense contemporary presence of Earth observation satellites, having a
                    wealth of uses and benefits for life on Earth.<br><br>

                    Viewing human presence from space, particularly by humans directly, has been reported by some
                    astronauts to cause a cognitive shift in perception, especially while viewing the Earth from outer
                    space, this effect has been called the overview effect.</p>

                    experienced viewing large "starfields" while in space.<br><br>

                    Space observatories like the Hubble Space Telescope have been present in Earth's orbit, benefiting
                    from advantages from being outside Earth's atmosphere and away from its radio noise, resulting in

                    constitutes and how it should be lived, the discussion about direct (e.g. crewed) and mediated (e.g.
                    uncrewed) human presence, has been decisive for how space policy makers have chosen human presence
                    and its purposes.<br><br>

                    The relevance of this issue for space policy has risen with the advancement and resulting
                    possibilities of telerobotics, to the point where most of the human presence in space has been
                    reallized robotically, leaving direct human presence behind.

                    history by astronomy and was significant in order to relate to the heavens, that is to outer space
                    and its bodies.<br><br>

                    The historic argument between geocentrism and heliocentrism is one example about the location of

          </h1>
          <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Venturing into the environment of space can have negative effects
            on the human body. Significant adverse effects of long-term weightlessness include muscle atrophy and
            deterioration of the skeleton (spaceflight osteopenia). Other significant effects include a slowing of
            cardiovascular system functions, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, eyesight
            disorders and changes in the immune system. Additional symptoms include fluid redistribution (causing the
            "moon-face" appearance typical in pictures of astronauts experiencing weightlessness), loss of body
            mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and excess flatulence.<br><br>

            The engineering problems associated with leaving Earth and developing space propulsion systems have been
            examined for over a century, and millions of hours of research have been spent on them. In recent years
            there has been an increase in research on the issue of how humans can survive and work in space for extended
            and possibly indefinite periods of time. This question requires input from the physical and biological
            sciences and has now become the greatest challenge (other than funding) facing human space exploration. A
            fundamental step in overcoming this challenge is trying to understand the effects and impact of long-term
            space travel on the human body.<br><br>

            In October 2015, the NASA Office of Inspector General issued a health hazards report related to space
            exploration, including a human mission to Mars.<br><br>

            On 12 April 2019, NASA reported medical results, from the Astronaut Twin Study, where one astronaut twin
            spent a year in space on the International Space Station, while the other twin spent the year on Earth,
            which demonstrated several long-lasting changes, including those related to alterations in DNA and
            cognition, when one twin was compared with the other.<br><br>

            In November 2019, researchers reported that astronauts experienced serious blood flow and clot problems
            while on board the International Space Station, based on a six-month study of 11 healthy astronauts. The
            results may influence long-term spaceflight, including a mission to the planet Mars, according to the
            researchers.</p><code>

          <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Space food is a type of food product created and processed for
            consumption by astronauts during missions to outer space. The food has specific requirements of providing
            balanced nutrition for individuals working in space, while being easy and safe to store, prepare and consume
            in the machinery-filled weightless environments of crewed spacecraft. Most space food is freeze-dried to
            ensure a long shelf life.<br><br>

            In recent years, space food has been used by various nations engaging on space programs as a way to share
            and show off their cultural identity and facilitate intercultural communication. Although astronauts consume
            a wide variety of foods and beverages in space, the initial idea from The Man in Space Committee of the
            Space Science Board in 1963 was to supply astronauts with a formula diet that would supply all the needed
            vitamins and nutrients.</p><code>

          </h1>
          <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Space medicine is the practice of medicine on astronauts in outer
            space whereas astronautical hygiene is the application of science and technology to the prevention or
            control of exposure to the hazards that may cause astronaut ill health. Both these sciences work together to
            ensure that astronauts work in a safe environment. The main objective is to discover how well and for how
            long people can survive the extreme conditions in space, and how fast they can adapt to the Earth's
            environment after returning from their voyage. Medical consequences such as possible blindness and bone loss
            have been associated with human spaceflight.<br><br>

            In October 2015, the NASA Office of Inspector General issued a health hazards report related to space
            exploration, including a human mission to Mars.</p><code>

              <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Space neuroscience is the scientific study of the central
                nervous system (CNS) functions during spaceflight. Living systems can integrate the inputs from the
                senses to navigate in their environment and to coordinate posture, locomotion, and eye movements.
                Gravity has a fundamental role in controlling these functions. In weightlessness during spaceflight,
                integrating the sensory inputs and coordinating motor responses is harder to do because gravity is no
                longer sensed during free-fall. For example, the otolith organs of the vestibular system no longer
                signal head tilt relative to gravity when standing. However, they can still sense head translation
                during body motion. Ambiguities and changes in how the gravitational input is processed can lead to
                potential errors in perception, which affects spatial orientation and mental representation.
                Dysfunctions of the vestibular system are common during and immediately after spaceflight, such as space
                motion sickness in orbit and balance disorders after return to Earth.<br><br>

                Adaptation to weightlessness involves not just the Sensory-motor coupling functions, but some autonomic
                nervous system functions as well. Sleep disorders and orthostatic intolerance are also common during and
                after spaceflight. There is no hydrostatic pressure in a weightless environment. As a result, the
                redistribution of body fluids toward the upper body causes a decrease in leg volume, which may affect
                muscle viscosity and compliance. An increase in intracranial pressure may also be responsible for a
                decrease in near visual acuity. In addition, muscle mass and strength both decrease as a result of
                the reduced loading in weightlessness. Moreover, approximately 70% of astronauts experience space motion
                sickness to some degree during the first days. The drugs commonly used to combat motion sickness,
                such as scopolamine and promethazine, have soporific effects. These factors can lead to chronic fatigue.
                The challenge of integrative space medicine and physiology is to investigate the adaptation of the human
                body to spaceflight as a whole, and not just as the sum of body parts because all body functions are
                connected and interact with each other.</p><code>

          <h1 style="font-family:'Caesar Dressing', cursive;font-size: 50px;">Writing in space</h1>
          <p style="font-family: 'Galindo', cursive;">Several instruments have been used to write in outer space,
            including different types of pencils and pens. Some of them have been unmodified versions of conventional
            writing instruments; others have been invented specifically to counter the problems with writing in space
            conditions.<br><br>

            A common misconception states that, faced with the fact that ball-point pens would not write in
            zero-gravity, the Fisher Space Pen was devised as the result of millions of dollars of unnecessary spending
            on NASA's part[citation needed] when the Soviet Union took the simpler and cheaper route of just using
            pencils, making the pen an example of overengineering.<br><br>

            In reality, the space pen was independently developed by Paul C. Fisher, founder of the Fisher Pen Company,
            with $1 million of his own funds. NASA tested and approved the pen for space use, especially
            since they were less flammable than pencils, then purchased 400 pens at $6 per pen. The Soviet Union
            subsequently also purchased the space pen for its Soyuz spaceflights.<br><br>

            When practically all writing in space intended for permanent record (e.g., logs, details and results of
            scientific experiments) is electronic, the discussion of writing instruments in space is somewhat academic:
            hard copy is produced infrequently, as of 2019. The laptops used (as of 2012, IBM/Lenovo ThinkPads) need
            customization for space use, such as radiation-, heat- and fire-resistance.</p><code>
